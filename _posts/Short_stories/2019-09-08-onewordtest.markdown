I was in my 12th standard. It was about one month before the public exam. I and my friends Laxman & Abish were more focused on scoring maximum cut-off marks.📚 Laxman was targeting centum in all three subjects. He had arranged a Physics 'one mark' test from Mr.Tamilselvan, one of the reputed physics tuition professors.
All three of us reached professor’s house on time. Laxman called the professor. I was admiring the beauty of professor’s house🏤, eager to get in and see the interior work. Abish was revising his notes.
"Hey! My boys! Good to see students appearing for 'one mark' test on their own interest." Professor said.😊
"Thank you Sir for conducting this test", Laxman said.
"That's fine. Please wait here. I will bring the question paper", He said and went inside his house.
I was shocked😮 when he asked us to wait outside.
I turned towards Laxman to know whether he was also shocked. But he was sincerely cleaning the steps at the entrance to use them as seats.😏
Professor came with question papers and we started our test.
There were 75 questions and we completed them in half an hour. Laxman was about to call professor.
I stopped him and pressed the doorbell instead.
He came out and asked us to note down the answers.
After dictating 25 answers,
"Do you need answers for all questions?"
"It would be helpful sir if you could give all the answers" Laxman said.
"They are previously asked questions. So you may find them in your question banks."
We were not satisfied with his reply. Abish looked disappointed.😞
"Fine Sir. We will try to find the answers and will reach you if we need any help." Abish said in low voice.
"Sure" He replied.
We thanked him and started walking away.
We heard a voice calling us out from behind, "Guys please come inside"🤔
I couldn’t believe my ears.😯 All three of us became enthusiastic.
When Laxman rushed into the house🏃‍♂️, I was adjusting my foot steps so that I stepped in my right foot first.🤸‍♀️🚶‍♂️
Once we entered the house we understood why he had asked us to write the test outside.
From the family photo on the right corner, we realised that our school mate Selvi was his daughter.👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
Abish looked at me asking "Are we that worse in character?"
“May be”, I thought.🙋‍♂️
But Laxman looked cheerful and bright🤩. He was searching for someone in the house.
"Please be there. Don’t come down." professor informed someone in the first floor.
We were clear to whom he made such statement.
Laxman's head faced first floor immediately. 😛
I adjusted his head to face the ground floor and asked "Is your target Centum or Selvi?"💃🤔
Laxman blushed and it was a horrible sight😠.
“I need your help in correcting few answer papers.” Professor said.
“My friend too needs your help in correcting your daughter.” I thought to myself in anger.😏
.

Laxman had used physics 'one mark' test to know the chemistry between him & Selvi.
Meanwhile, I and Abish has become his Partha.😶
😃😃
