On that day I was starting to my friend’s home. When I was getting ready I found three 5 rupee coins on my dad’s table. I took those three coins as my unofficial pocket money without anyone’s notice. To be more precise I stole them.
I bought three 5 star chocolates🍫🍫🍫 as I was so crazy on them. 
When I reached my friend’s home, I found it locked. So I returned home thinking where he would have gone without informing me. By the time I reached my home I had forgotten to eat those chocolates. 
Seeing my bulged pocket my mom asked me ‘What’s that?’
I was dumbfounded.😐
‘Rest in Peace Rk’ was my mind voice.😥 It started developing a story.
Now my mom asked me again and I remained like a statue. After losing her patience, my mom came closer to me and took those chocolates from my pocket.
My mind accelerated the speed in penning a story as she would not leave me for sure.✍️
‘Who gave you these chocolates when I haven’t given you any money?’ she asked as expected.
‘My friend’ I lied.
‘Your friend gave you three chocolates? Three 5 star chocolates? I could not believe this.’ My mom said.
‘How exactly she knew about him?’ my inner voice exclaimed.
‘No mom. He gave me one… Then..’ I started & paused.
‘…his younger brother gave me one…’ I paused again and looked at her reaction🙄. She seemed believing my story. So I continued in the same track.
‘ Then his elder brother gave me another one.’ I completed my story after giving life to my friend’s brothers.
‘Oh…! Is it? So sweet’, she said without eating the chocolates.
‘Escaped’ I whispered. 😋
But it did not prevail for more than three seconds.
‘But why each of them gave you chocolate?’ She started her question series.
‘Who knows..!!😶’ my mind screamed.
‘Because…’ I started but unable to complete.
‘Hmm.. Because?’ she tried to pull words.
‘Because today is their mom's birthday🎂’ I lied with a smile.
‘Oh.. Good. Keep it in fridge and eat one by one’ my mom said after she believed me completely.
I was proud of myself for a moment.
Suddenly my mom asked ‘you have never given 50 paise chocolates to anyone. How your friend would have bought this chocolate for you? Something is not working out.’
‘Ayayo…!!!😯😯’ my heart cried.
‘Ok Then let me surrender' my heart decided.
Suddenly my mastermind sent few words to my mouth.
‘All three brothers are celebrating their mother's birthday in grand fashion as all three of them were born to same mother’ I said without any pause to make her believe.😎😎
My mother confirmed that I cooked up a story and came towards me with a stick.😠
Action sequence started
